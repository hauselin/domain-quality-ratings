# data

`domain_ratings.csv` contains ratings generated by our ensemble method (imputation + principal component analysis). For details regarding our methodology, see our [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad286).

 - `domain`: domain/url
 - `pc1`: first component from PCA (0: lowest quality, 1: highest quality)
 - other columns: see our [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad286)

If you want only the `pc1` ratings, download `domain_pc1.csv` instead.

Alternatively, visit https://www.domain-quality.info to search for domains.
